---
This project contains solutions for Activities 1 to 20.
Each activity is placed in its own Java file inside the Activities folder.
Every activity contains a:
---
public static void run()
---
method, and all activities are executed through the Main.java file located in the src folder.

This structure follows the instructions:
Use public static methods
Place activities in separate files
Store them inside one folder
Call all activities from Main.java
